# MASCoT
Multi-Aspect Sentiment analysis with Contrastive Learning and Temporal Insights

## Overview

MASCoT is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance the robustness, interpretability, and temporal awareness of multi-aspect sentiment analysis models. It leverages advanced techniques in natural language processing, such as contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, to improve the accuracy and generalizability of sentiment analysis.

## Repository Structure

- dataframes/: Contains the training, validation, and testing dataframes used for model training and evaluation.
- final/: Holds the best-trained model.
- embeddings.py: Handles preprocessing, embedding generation, and training tasks.
- preprocess.py: Script for data preprocessing tasks.
- train.py: Main script for training the model.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
